# Many-to-Many
Hibernate JPA with Many-to-Many mapping


Project requirements:

Java 8+
Idea to work in (Intelij in my case)
PostgreSQL server connected do server given below
Application server with configurations already prepared to deploy war file (I used https://wildfly.org/downloads/ standalone module)
In the project files:

src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml there is username and password for postgerSQL server needed:

<property name="connection.username">***TYPE YOUR USERNAME***</property>
<property name="connection.password">***TYPE YOUR PASSWORD***</property>
In pom.xml

At line 114:

<outputDirectory>E:/wildfly-16.0.0.Final/standalone/deployments</outputDirectory>
War file for application server will be deployed in given directory. It needs to be changed to servers directory, that will deploy war.

To deploy war file use maven build check: clean, install and run the application.

To access application go to address: http://localhost:8080/One-to-One-uni-1.0-SNAPSHOT/InstructorUIServlet

There are three basic operations that project does in this order:
- Adds first student on the list to first course on the list;
- Deletes last student and last course on the list;
- Shows table with student first name, student last name and course title;
